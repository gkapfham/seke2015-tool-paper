{\bf Future Work and Conclusion}.  While we recently used \toolname to
study search-based test data generation in the domain of relational
database schemas~\cite{kinneer2015}, the tool is general and can be
applied to many other problem domains. Future work includes using \toolname
to evaluate the efficiency of \textsc{EvoSuite}'s approach to test data
generation for Java programs~\cite{fraser2013}.  In conclusion,
\toolname makes empirically evaluating the worst-case time complexity of
algorithms much more convenient.  By automating the process of
conducting these experiments, \toolname enables large-scale empirical
studies that would otherwise be infeasible.

  % TODO should I cite EvoSuite?
