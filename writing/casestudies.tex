    {\bf Case study: Sorting Algorithms}.  Included with the
    \toolname~tool is an example doubling experiment called
    \texttt{SortingExperiment}.  This program provides a number of
    canonical sorting algorithms with well-known worst-case time
    complexities.  Doubling experiments may be performed on these
    algorithms by running the command \texttt{java SortingExperiment
    algname}, replacing \texttt{algname} with the name of the desired
    sorting algorithm. Running the command without providing
    \texttt{algname} will show a list of options. When run 1000 times
    for each of the five provided sorting algorithms, \toolname~achieves
    an accuracy of $98.84\%$.

    {\bf Case study: \textit{SchemaAnalyst}}. In other
    work~\cite{kinneer2015}, we used \toolname~to perform a
    comprehensive analysis of the search-based test data generation
    tool, \textit{SchemaAnalyst}, that generates test suites for
    relational database schemas~\cite{kapfhammer2013}. Since it is much
    more complicated than a sorting algorithm, performing doubling
    experiments on \textit{SchemaAnalyst} requires more parameters than
    needed to study sorting.  To conduct these experiments, we developed
    a class called \texttt{SchemaExperiment} that extends
    \texttt{DoublingExperiment}.  We developed \texttt{SchemaExperiment}
    to allow for conducting doubling experiments using a variety of
    \textit{SchemaAnalyst} configurations, as well as accessing
    \toolname's parameters.

Following the terminology from~\cite{kempka2015}, a doubling experiment
to evaluate \textit{SchemaAnalyst} using the AICC criterion, a random
data generator, the RiskIt database schema, and the number of
\texttt{NOT NULL}s in the schema will run with this command:
\texttt{java SchemaExperiment -criterion AICC -datagenerator random
-schema RiskIt -doubler DoubleNotNullsSemantic}.  Although less accurate
than in the sorting case study, \toolname~still successfully revealed
meaningful trends in \textit{SchemaAnalyst}'s
performance~\cite{kinneer2015}.
