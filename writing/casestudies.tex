    {\bf Case study: Sorting Algorithms}.  Included with the
    \toolname~tool is an example doubling experiment called
    \texttt{SortingExperiment}.  This program provides a number of
    canonical sorting algorithms with well-known worst-case time
    complexities.  Doubling experiments may be performed on these
    algorithms by running the command \texttt{java SortingExperiment
    algname}, replacing \texttt{algname} with the name of the desired
    sorting algorithm. Running the command without providing
    \texttt{algname} will show a list of options. When run 1000 times
    for each of the five provided sorting algorithms, \toolname~achieve
    an accuracy of $98.84\%$.

    {\bf Case study: \textit{SchemaAnalyst}} In other
    work~\cite{kinneer2015}, we used \toolname~to perform a
    comprehensive analysis of the search-based test data generation
    tool, \textit{SchemaAnalyst}, that generates test suites for
    relational database schemas~\cite{kapfhammer2013}. Since it is much
    more complicated than a sorting algorithm, performing doubling
    experiments on \textit{SchemaAnalyst} requires more parameters than
    needed to study sorting.  To conduct these experiments, we developed
    a class called \texttt{SchemaExperiment} that extends
    \texttt{DoublingExperiment}.  We developed \texttt{SchemaExperiment}
    to allow for conducting doubling experiments using a variety of
    \textit{SchemaAnalyst} configurations, as well as accessing
    \toolname's parameters.

    A doubling experiment that evaluates \textit{SchemaAnalyst} using
    the AICC coverage criterion, random data generator, RiskIt as the initial input
    schema, and according to the number of \textsc{NotNull}s present in the
    schema can be run by the following command:
    \texttt{java SchemaExperiment -criterion AICC -datagenerator random
    -schema RiskIt -doubler DoubleNotNullsSemantic}.
